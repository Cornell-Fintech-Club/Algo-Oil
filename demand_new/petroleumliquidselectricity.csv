"Notes: Beginning with the collection of Form EIA-923 in January 2008, the methodology to allocate total fuel consumption for electricity generation and consumption for useful thermal output was changed.
The new methodology was retroactively applied to 2004-2007 data. See the Technical Notes (Appendix C) for further information. See Glossary for definitions.
Values for 2022 and prior years are final. Values for 2023 and 2024 are preliminary. See Technical Notes for a discussion of the sample design for the Form EIA-923 and predecessor forms.
Petroleum Liquids includes distillate and residual fuel oils, jet fuel, kerosene, waste oil, and beginning in 2011, propane. Prior to 2011 propane was included in Other Gases.
See the Technical Notes for fuel conversion factors.
Totals may not equal sum of components because of independent rounding.

Beginning with 2008 data, the Form EIA-923, Power Plant Operations Report, replaced the following: Form EIA-906, Power Plant Report; Form EIA-920, Combined Heat and Power Plant Report.",,,,,
